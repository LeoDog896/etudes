This is a repository for the source code of various 3D programlets.

### Hearts [WebGL]
One of the most aesthetically pleasing heart curve is defined by (x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>-1)<sup>3</sup>-x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup>=0. Let's improvise on it. [Live demo](webgl/hearts.html).

### Negative Light [Three.js]
Three.js allows negative intensities of lights. This might be used to simulate circular soft shadows. [Live demo](threejs/negative-light.html).
