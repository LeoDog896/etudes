# Ã‰tudes 3D
This is a repository for the source code of various 3D programlets.

### Neon tori [WebGL]
Using shader to generate neonish shiny surface of a torus. Colour stripes are define by the direction of the reflection rays. [Live demo](https://boytchev.github.io/etudes/webgl/neon-tori.html).

### Snowing [Three.js]
A simple model of snowing scene. The snowflake's texture is generated programmatically. [Live demo](https://boytchev.github.io/etudes/threejs/snowing.html). 

### Hearts [WebGL]
One of the most aesthetically pleasing heart curve is defined by (x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>-1)<sup>3</sup>-x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup>=0. Let's improvise on it. [Live demo](https://boytchev.github.io/etudes/webgl/hearts.html).

### Negative Light [Three.js]
Three.js allows negative intensities of lights. This might be used to simulate circular soft shadows. [Live demo](https://boytchev.github.io/etudes/threejs/negative-light.html).
