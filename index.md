This is a repository for the source code of various 3D programlets.

### Supersphere [WebGL]
Spheres, cubes, octahedrons ... are all instances of the supesphere X<sup><small>n</small></sup> + Y<sup><small>n</small></sup> + Z<sup><small>n</small></sup> = 1. [Live demo](https://boytchev.github.io/etudes/webgl/supersphere.html).

### Crystal planet [Three.js]
A planet is created as a level-5 icosahedron with a randomized geometry &ndash; actually, only the distance to the center is randomized. [Live demo](threejs/crystal-planet.html). 

### Neon tori [WebGL]
Using shader to generate neonish shiny surface of a torus. Colour stripes are defined by the direction of the reflection rays. [Live demo](https://boytchev.github.io/etudes/webgl/neon-tori.html).

### Snowing [Three.js]
A simple model of snowing scene. The snowflake's texture is generated programmatically. [Live demo](threejs/snowing.html). 

### Hearts [WebGL]
One of the most aesthetically pleasing heart curve is defined by (x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>-1)<sup>3</sup>-x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup>=0. Let's improvise on it. [Live demo](webgl/hearts.html).

### Negative Light [Three.js]
Three.js allows negative intensities of lights. This might be used to simulate circular soft shadows. [Live demo](threejs/negative-light.html).
