This is a repository for the source code of various 3D programlets.

### Look Ma, no quaternions [Three.js]
For free-walking on a sphere you can use pure Three.js vector arithmetic. No need to fight with quaternions, matrices, Euler angles and gimbal locks. Slide the mouse or your finger to see it in this [Live demo](threejs/look-ma-no-quaternions.html). 

### Minimalistic village [Three.js]
Sometimes simple minimalistic solutions provide enough complexity. A 2D upvote arrow shape could be extruded into a house. And then, multiple houses could be arranged in a small village. [Live demo](threejs/minimalistic-village.html). 

### Sine cheers [WebGL]
The sine curve can be used to define hundreds of rotational shapes. Do you know that the wine jug and the wine glass are among those shapes? See [here](webgl/sine-cheers-graph.jpg). Cheers! [Live demo](webgl/sine-cheers.html).

### Lantern [Three.js]
Constructive Solid Geometry ([CSG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry)) is a technique to build models by combining, subtracting or intersecting shapes. CSG also provides algebraic notation of models' construction. [Live demo](threejs/lantern.html). 

### Graphical integration [WebGL]
Every curved or bending surface could be represented by a set of small flat plates. This is the computer graphics analog to mathematical integration. [Live demo](webgl/graphical-integration.html).

### Bingo balls [Three.js]
Not all textures need to be loaded from files. These bingo balls get their textures drawn at startup via [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). [Live demo](threejs/bingo-balls.html). 

### Supersphere [WebGL]
Spheres, cubes, octahedrons ... are all instances of the supesphere X<sup><small>n</small></sup> + Y<sup><small>n</small></sup> + Z<sup><small>n</small></sup> = 1. [Live demo](webgl/supersphere.html).

### Crystal planet [Three.js]
A planet is created as a level-5 icosahedron with a randomized geometry &ndash; actually, only the distance to the center is randomized. [Live demo](threejs/crystal-planet.html). 

### Neon tori [WebGL]
Using shader to generate neonish shiny surface of a torus. Colour stripes are defined by the direction of the reflection rays. [Live demo](webgl/neon-tori.html).

### Snowing [Three.js]
A simple model of snowing scene. The snowflake's texture is generated programmatically. [Live demo](threejs/snowing.html). 

### Hearts [WebGL]
One of the most aesthetically pleasing heart curve is defined by (x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>-1)<sup>3</sup>-x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup>=0. Let's improvise on it. [Live demo](webgl/hearts.html).

### Negative Light [Three.js]
Three.js allows negative intensities of lights. This might be used to simulate circular soft shadows. [Live demo](threejs/negative-light.html).
